            <p> V1: Basically the index.html has layed out the minimum foundation
                for the home page. It has displayed the navigation bar and has an introduction
                for people who visit the cite. Styles.css has has the color and fonts I wanted displayed 
                one the site as of right now. These are all temporary and I may make drastic
                css changes in the future. 5/2/2020

            <p>V2: No new pages were added but css has helped in improving the looks
              of the site overall. There's a new background image and smoother ui in general to help 
              make the pages look more inviting. There's even a prompt on the smash logo
              on the home page to take the user to the official smash website, if they wanted to find
              more info that I couldn't provide. 5/16/2020
